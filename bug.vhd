process (clk) begin
  if rising_edge(clk) then

This code has a potential race condition. If the reset signal (rst) changes at the same time as the clock edge, the behavior is undefined.  The order of operations is not guaranteed, leading to unpredictable results. The reset might not be recognized, or the count might be incremented incorrectly.
