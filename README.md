This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in VHDL code: a race condition involving a reset signal and a clock edge. The bug.vhd file contains the problematic code, while bugSolution.vhd provides a corrected version.  The race condition arises because the order of operations when the clock edge and reset change simultaneously is not guaranteed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and intermittent failures. The solution employs a more robust approach to avoid the race condition, ensuring reliable reset behavior.
